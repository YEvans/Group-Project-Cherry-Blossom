        <p>A cherry blossom is a flower of many trees of genus Prunus or Prunus subg. Cerasus. They are also known as
            Japanese cherry and sakura. They generally refer to ornamental cherry trees, not to edible cherry trees. It
            is considered the national flower of Japan.
        </p>
        <p>Timing the cherry blossoms perfectly is a bit of a combination of research, perseverance, and luck since the
            weather can shift the blossoms anywhere from a couple days early to a couple weeks late! So how do you plan
            a trip to Japan way in advance in hopes of catching the Cherry Blossoms in bloom? Our advice is to aim to
            catch it on the later side since catching it too early means you’ll just see a lot of barren trees. If you
            manage to catch it right at peak that’s a bonus - but catching it late at least means the floor will be
            covered in the blossoms and you’ll see them flying all over the place. The general consensus is that the
            cherry blossoms start blooming around mid to late March and peak from late March to early April. The cherry
            blossoms are still pretty after the peak, since they start to fall on the ground and the air is filled with
            them.</p>
